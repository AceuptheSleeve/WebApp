        <p> 
        I started my programming adventure at the age of 13, with Whitehat Jr. where I got my Game Delevoper and App Developer Certifications.
        After that, I took up 'Intro to Computer Science' in High School where I learned Java. Later that school year I learned of the Delaware Area Carrer Center's Application Development course.
        That is where I currently learn today.
